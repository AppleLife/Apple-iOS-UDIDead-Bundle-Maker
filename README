UDIDead Bundle Maker:
=====================
A little program I made for people to use when another new beta comes out and we haven't made a bundle yet.
This requires Ionic.Zip

args:
-b <firmware build>
-f <firmware version>

(optional:)

-o <output directory>

UDIDead bypasses the need to either purchase the iOS developer program or get your best hacker friend to register your UDID by simply using a redsn0w bundle.
