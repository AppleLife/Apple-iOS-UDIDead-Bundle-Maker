UDIDead Bundle Maker:
A little program I made for people to use when another new beta comes out and we havent made a bundle yet.
This requires Ionic.Zip

args:
-b <firmware build>
-f <firmware version>

(optional:)

-o <output directory>

By all means, use the code, but if it involves anything to do with UDIDead, please give credit.

Lots of love, 
StanTheRipper.
